# Qiskit-Quantum-Approach-To-Rendezvous-Probelem
This is the repository for Team Rendezvous at the Qiskit Camp 2019 taking place in Mürren, Switzerland. 

## Qiskit Camp 
Qiskit is an open-source quantum computing framework for leveraging today's quantum processors in research, education, and business.

## The Classical Rendezvous Connundrum 
The aim is to build on a quantum advantage by using Grover's algorithm to the Rendezvous Problem. The problem is as follows: Alice & Bob, two 20 year olds have agreed to meet at a park. The only details they have before hand is the date and time of their meeting and a pre-agreed strategy on how they'll find each other. Once Alice and Bob arive at the park, they have no means of communicating with each other. The connundrum they face is based on the method of finding each other, which route would lead to the best possible probability of findind the other? How much time would that take? Should they wait before they start or wait at any point during their search?

The idea and process behind the classical approach is described in detail in this [research paper](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S0363012993249195).
